# Sports-Image-Classification

Fatkun Chrome Extension was used to download images of sports personalities from the internet. Haar Cascade approach is implemented in this project to detect faces of personalities. It runs on an important condition that if a pair of eyes is not detected in an image, the image is discarded.
Open CV Python library is used to detect objects and wavelet transformation technique is used to extract important features from the images like the eyes, lips, ears etc.
SVM with Linear kernel, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models are trained to find out the model with the best score.
